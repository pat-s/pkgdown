\description{
Your \code{NEWS.md} is parsed in to sections based on your use of
headings. Each minor version (i.e. the combination of first and second
components) gets on one page, with all patch versions (i.e. the third
component) on a single page. News items for development versions (by
convention those versions with a fourth component) are displayed on an
an "unreleased" page.
}
\details{
The \code{NEWS.md} file should be formatted somewhat like this:

\preformatted{
# pkgdown 0.1.0.9000

## Major changes

- Fresh approach based on the staticdocs package. Site configuration now based on YAML files.

...
}

Commonly used subsection headers include 'Major changes', 'Bug fixes', 'Minor
changes'.

Issues and contributors mentioned in news items are automatically linked to
github if a \code{URL} entry linking to github.com is provided in the package
\code{DESCRIPTION}.

\preformatted{
## Major changes

- Lots of bug fixes (@hadley, #100)
}

If the package is available on CRAN, release dates will be added for listed versions.
}
\section{YAML config}{


To automatically link to release announcements, include a \code{releases}
section.

\preformatted{
news:
 releases:
 - text: "usethis 1.3.0"
   href: https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/02/usethis-1-3-0/
 - text: "usethis 1.0.0 (and 1.1.0)"
   href: https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/usethis-1.0.0/
}

Control whether news is present on one page or multiple pages with the
\code{one_page} field. The default is \code{true}.

\preformatted{
news:
- one_page: false
}
}
